# Graduate Trainee Management System - Simple Software Requirements

## **What We're Building**

A basic web system to manage trainee development for a 50-employee IT company. Four user types: Management, HR, Team Leads, and Trainees.

**RULE**: HR creates trainee first, then trainee can access the system.

## **MODULE 1: TRAINEE CREATION & PRE-JOINING**

### **What It Does:**

* HR creates new trainee accounts

* HR assigns links to training materials (YouTube videos, online courses, documents)

* HR schedules Google Meet sessions (bi-weekly)

* System tracks if trainees completed their assignments

### **How It Works:**

* HR adds trainee name, email, start date

* HR adds links to courses/materials trainees should complete before joining

* HR creates Google Meet sessions and adds trainees

* Trainees log in, see their assignments, complete them, mark as done

* HR sees who completed what

## **MODULE 2: ONBOARDING**

### **What It Does:**

* HR uploads company policies, procedures (PDF files, links)

* Trainees read through them

* System asks simple questions to check understanding

* Tracks who completed what

### **How It Works:**

* HR uploads documents or adds links

* HR creates 3-5 simple questions for each document

* Trainee reads document, answers questions

* Must get questions right to mark as completed

* HR sees completion status

## **MODULE 3: TRAINING MANAGEMENT**

### **What It Does:**

* Team Leads create learning paths (list of courses/materials)

* Support different types: YouTube links, online course links, PDF uploads

* For online courses: store login details

* After each course: ask verification questions

* Track progress with timelines and deadlines

* Weekly/monthly schedule planning

* Skills tracking and competency mapping

* Automated alerts when trainees fall behind

### **How It Works:**

* Team Lead creates a "path" (e.g., "Java Developer Training")

  * Type 1: Direct link (YouTube, article, documentation)

  * Type 2: Course link + username/password for trainee

  * Type 3: Upload PDF/document

* For each item: add 3-5 verification questions + expected time to complete

* Creates weekly plans (e.g., "This week: complete 3 courses")

* Trainee completes external training, returns to system

* Trainee answers questions correctly = marked complete

* System tracks time taken vs expected time

* Automatic alerts to HR/Team Lead if trainee is behind schedule
